# FraudProject
Building Hybrid Technique For Credit Card Fraud Detection In Nigerian Banking System

# Preparation
Step 1: First create a virtual environment name venv or anyname you most have python install in system. run =>

    python -m venv venv

Step 2: Activate the virtual environment

    venv/Scripts/activate

Step 3: Clone the repository

    mkdir Project
    cd Project

    git clone https://github.com/SilasEmma/FraudProject.git

Step 4: Install Python libraries

    pip install requirements.txt

Step 4: Install jupyter notebook for the virtual environment

    ipython kernel install --user --name=venv

Step 6: Run Jupyter notebook

    jupyter notebook

**What PyGad is**

    PyGAD is an open-source easy to use Python library for building the genetic algorithm
    and optimizing machine learning algorithms. It works with Keras and PyTorch.

**What MLflow is**

    MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning
    lifecycle. It has the following primary components:

    Tracking: Record and query experiments code, data, config, and results
    Project: Package data science code in a format to reproduce runs on any platform
    Models: Deploy machine learning models in diverse serving environments
    Registry: Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central repository

**What Tensorflow and Keras**

    TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple 
    machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library
    that runs on top of TensorFlow. Both provide high-level APIs used for easily
    building and training models, but Keras is more user-friendly because it's
    built-in Python.
